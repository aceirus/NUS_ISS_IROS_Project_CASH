### INTRODUCTION

With the ubiquitous cellphone getting more and more in volved in every aspect of our life, people are spending a lot of time looking at their cellphones for various activities. However, sometimes people’s experience with their cellphones is not particularly good. For example, when in the kitchen preparing food, it is common to see people using their phones to view recipes or videos demonstrating how a dish is being made. However, people often find it very difficult to keep up with the steps in the recipe or videos, because they often need to constantly move around and monitor many things thus it is impossible to be always keeping an eye on the screen. One option is to hold the phone with them in one hand and work with the other hand, but the problem is that not everyone has the flexibility to use only one hand for tasks. The same embarrassment also occurs when making handicrafts and repairing equipment, etc. At that moment, people often want to have a “third hand”. Another issue often occurs when people look at their phones for long periods of time for reading e-books or even enjoying an online movie. Not only will their hands get tired holding the device, a prolong incorrect neck posture will result in long term neck and spinal issues that is detrimental to a person’s well-being.

To address these problems, we propose a smart and novel robotic cellphone holder system called Cellphone Adaptive Smart Holder (CASH) that tracks the user’s movements and intelligently adjusts its position to ensure the user maintain a good viewing angle. This system integrates cutting-edge computer vision models such as Face Detection, Face Pose Estimation, Hand Detection and Gesture Recognition models, as well as the classic PID control system to achieve accurate and smooth real-time tracking of targets. To apply the PID algorithm on the Braccio manipulator, a special driver is proposed. In addition, it also features an alert system that will notify the user whenever an undesirable neck posture is detected. In this work, we also conducted experimental comparisons of some existing methods. We believe that these explorations will help to create a truly practical and feasible industrial-grade product in this direction.
